### Abstract:
(Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

- In this project we built more features to our little shop project. We built the ability to add coupons to merchants with either a dollar or percent off. 
- We also made sure that a merchant can't have more than one of the same coupon and also no more than 5 active coupons per merchant. 
- The problem this app is solving is it allows merchants to offer thier products at a cheaper rate, hopefully bringing in more customers and revenue.
